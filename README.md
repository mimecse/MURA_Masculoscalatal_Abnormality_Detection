# MURA_Masculoscalatal_Abnormality_Detection

This repository contains an implementation of the DenseNet121 model for the task of abnormality detection in musculoskeletal Radiographs on the MURA dataset.


**Dataset: MURA v1.1**

MURA (musculoskeletal radiographs) is a large dataset of bone X-rays. It contains 7 types of X-ray images of the shoulder, humerus, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, and finger. Here is the classification type we used in the following image:
